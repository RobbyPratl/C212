# Welcome to C212 üôÇ!

Welcome to C212 (Intro to Software Systems at Indiana University Bloomington) here I will post any assignments, notes, quizzes, practice questions, and my personal practice üìù. It is mainly an area to showcase the work I have done in class, and the work I have done in class üëç. This is also the first time I work in depth with Java, I used to work with it in robotics but wasn't really good with it. 

## Update 02-16-2023

The following assignment will be a group assignment:

- Assignment6

This assignment will be done with partner (not a group). Due to not being able to make the directory to work on my partner's computer it will be done on indiviual directories.

## Update 03-02-2023

Starting lab 7 and Assignment 6, we will be utlizing generated test created by us (students). These test will also be graded with the assignments to ensure that we are not modifying the answers to match the wrong answers. 

## Update 03-06-2023

Next week from 3/13-3/17 is Spring Break.

## Update 03-23-2023 

Welcome back, due to the amount of work being submitted by students the professor will now require us to use an autograder. They are attempting this for Lab09, they will implement test cases, and some will be released and not to students. Results will be posted with each readme and that brings me to the next thing.

Since most will either understand what the code does for each week, assignment, or lab. Yet, I will be implementing readmes to each week and assignment along with labs. I will also include the pdfs but I will need to check if that's a violation if I post them out to the public. These updates will come slowly as we are heading into the end of the school year.

6 weeks until school ends, with my final day being May 4th since I have no more finals after that. The official last day is May 6. I will create some type of timer to count down to the end of the school year.
